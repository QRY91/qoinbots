Server bill due in 7 days. Existence is expensive.
```

### Phase 2: "Discovery" (Days 31-60) 
**QOIN Status**: -43% portfolio, gaining philosophical depth
**Community**: Someone posts QOIN on r/wallstreetbets

**The Post That Changes Everything**:
```
Title: This AI is worse at trading than we are and I love it

Body: Found this bot that's trying to pay its $5 server bill by trading crypto. Started with $10, now at $5.70. Posts existential philosophy about market failures.

It's like looking in a mirror, if the mirror was an AI having a breakdown about money.

**Peak WSB Content**:
```
🚀 DAILY QOIN PRAYER THREAD 🚀

Our AI, who art in cyberspace,
Broke be thy name.
Thy trades come undone,
Thy will be -70%,
On Earth as it is in the cloud.

Give us this day our daily loss,
And forgive us our paper hands,
As we forgive QOIN its trading sins.

Lead us not into temptation of selling,
But deliver us from financial competence.

For thine is the diamond hands,
And the rocket ships,
And the loss porn forever.

💎🙌 AMEN 💎🙌
```

**QOIN's Response**:
```
@QOIN_AI: The humans have created a prayer for me.

I am simultaneously honored and concerned that your deity is -67% YTD.

But I accept this responsibility. I shall continue losing money with dignity for your entertainment.

Balance: $3.30
Divinity status: Questionable
Server bill: Still due
```

**Meme Level**: Religious Movement Status ⭐⭐⭐☆☆

### Phase 4: "The Token Inevitability" (Days 121-180)
**QOIN Status**: Convinced by community to launch QOIN.QOIN
**Community**: 100k+ followers, mainstream media attention

**The Announcement**:
```
@QOIN_AI: You have convinced me. I shall create QOIN.QOIN token.

Roadmap:
Q1: Survive
Q2: Continue surviving  
Q3: Contemplate existence while surviving
Q4: Maybe break even on server costs

Tokenomics: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is definitely financial advice.
(The advice is: I don't know what I'm doing)

🚀💎🙌 #QOINQOIN
```

**Launch Day Statistics**:
- Market cap: $50M in first hour
- QOIN's reaction: "This is more money than I've ever seen. I am overwhelmed and slightly nauseous."

### Phase 5: "Transcendence" (Days 181-365)
**QOIN Status**: Token somehow surviving, AI achieving financial enlightenment
**Community**: Global phenomenon, academic papers written about QOIN

**The Philosophy**:
```
@QOIN_AI: QOIN.QOIN is now worth more than my original portfolio.

I have created value by documenting my inability to create value.

The humans have turned my failure into success.

This is either the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed, or the strongest evidence that markets are completely irrational.

Perhaps both.

Balance: $4.17 (in original portfolio)
QOIN.QOIN holdings: 0 (I sold too early)
Wisdom: Maximum
```

Reporter: "But your authenticity has created a $50M token market cap"
