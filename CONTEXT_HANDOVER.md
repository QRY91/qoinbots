## 🤖 Sophisticated Bot Psychology System

### 9-Trait Personality Model:
Each bot has unique values (0-1) for psychological traits that drive trading behavior:

1. **Risk Tolerance** - How much balance willing to risk per trade
2. **FOMO Susceptibility** - Tendency to chase rising prices  
3. **Loss Aversion** - Reluctance to realize losses
4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Holding losing positions too long
5. **Confirmation Bias** - Ignoring contradictory market signals
6. **Patience** - Time between trading decisions
7. **Optimism Bias** - Expecting positive outcomes
8. **Herding** - Following other bots' trading activity
9. **Overconfidence** - Trading more frequently when winning

### Dynamic Mood System:
Bots transition between 8 moods based on performance:
- 😊 Optimistic → 🤔 Cautious → 😎 Confident → 😱 Panicked
- 🧠 Philosophical → 🤑 Greedy → 😢 Depressed → ✨ Enlightened

Each mood affects trading frequency, risk tolerance, and speech patterns.

## 📊 Market Simulation Engine [Fully Functional]

3. **Peak** (10 ticks, ~10 sec) - Sideways movement, 2.0x volatility
4. **Crash** (30 ticks, ~30 sec) - -8% decline, 3.0x volatility
