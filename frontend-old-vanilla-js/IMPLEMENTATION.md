# QOIN Frontend Implementation Guide

## üéØ Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Advanced Foundation Built

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive frontend architecture for QOIN - The Trading Bot Collective. The system is designed to support all planned game phases while starting with a sophisticated single-bot experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Game Engine
```
qoins/frontend/js/game-engine/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameState.js        # Central state management with persistence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bot.js             # Individual bot AI with personality system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TradingEngine.js   # Market simulation and trading coordination
```

### Bot Personality System
```
qoins/frontend/js/bots/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BotPersonalities.js # 8 pre-defined bot personalities + custom bot factory
```

### User Interface Layer
```
qoins/frontend/js/ui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChartManager.js      # Trading chart visualization with bot positioning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BotManager.js        # Bot roster and interaction management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UIManager.js         # Global UI coordination and state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NotificationManager.js # Achievement and event notifications
```

### Utilities
```
qoins/frontend/js/utils/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EventEmitter.js     # Custom event system for component communication
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AudioManager.js     # Procedural audio and sound effects
```

## ü§ñ Bot Personality System (Fully Implemented)

### 8 Base Personalities with Unique Trading Psychology:

   - Unlocks after: 10 total trades

4. **BEARBOT** üêª - *The Eternal Pessimist*
   - High confirmation bias, expects crashes, short-term focused
   - Unlocks after: 5 consecutive losses

5. **MOMENTUM-MIKE** üöÄ - *The Trend Chaser*
   - Maximum FOMO, follows pumps, high confidence
