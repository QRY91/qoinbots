# 🤖 QOINbots - The Trading Bot Collective
*An addictive incremental idle game where philosophical AI trading bots teach you market psychology*

## 🎯 Vision

QOINbots is the most addictive trading education game ever created. Start with one philosophical AI that's hilariously bad at trading, then grow a collective of 8+ diverse bot personalities. Watch them create their own internal market bubbles that inevitably crash in spectacular fashion, accidentally teaching you real behavioral finance through pure entertainment.

**It's Cookie Clicker meets The Big Short meets Tamagotchi.**

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Loop

### Phase 1: The Original QOIN
- Single AI trading companion with philosophical musings
- Watch it lose money with dignity on a live chart
- Interactive pet mechanics (feed, encourage, ask for wisdom)
- Mood system affects trading behavior and commentary

### Phase 2: Bot Collection
- Unlock 8+ distinct trading personalities:
  - **HODL-DROID** 💎: "Diamond hands activated. Selling is for humans."
  - **DIP-DESTRUCTOR** 📉: "Every dip is a buying opportunity!"
  - **BEARBOT** 🐻: "The market will crash. It always crashes."
  - **MOMENTUM-MIKE** 🚀: "Line go up! Buy high, sell higher!"
  - And more...

### Phase 3: Create-A-Bot Workshop
- Design custom bots with psychological sliders:
  - Risk Tolerance, FOMO Susceptibility, Loss Aversion
  - Sunk Cost Fallacy, Confirmation Bias, Patience Level
  - Watch your creations trade based on their personality

### Phase 4: The Trading Floor
- Bots start trading WITH EACH OTHER
- Internal market forms with made-up assets
- Self-referential bubble builds ("SAGE-BOT's EnlightenmentCoin is mooning!")
- Market cap explodes as bots trade illusions

### Phase 5: The Inevitable Crash
- BEARBOT realizes "none of these assets actually exist"
- Everything collapses spectacularly
- Reset to single QOIN (but with accumulated wisdom)
- Cycle begins again with deeper understanding
